LSAT High Altitude Scintillating Muon Detector @ ERAU DB
2023 - Present

Based on Prof. Axani's CosmicWatch, v.2, the HASMuD will attempt an altitude of 10km, maintaining data communication. 

Per the CosmicWatch Documentation, the detector sends out a count within a pre-set timespan, such as 1 - 10 seconds, and we will be adding an altimeter, accelerometer, barometer, and gyroscope for additional environmental data. 

We are testing for the threshold of Muon production in the upper atmosphere. There are existing papers done (Arslan 2015 - up to 5km) (Deck, Doricko, Gupta @ Berkeley ULAB - up to 2.5km) but we intend to go further with a hydrogen weather balloon.

We are using a 433 MHz Dipole Antenna, connected to the Arduino Nano where the SD card from v.2 would go. We are removing the OLED as well, and will be implementing as much of the v.3 programs that can run instead of the v.2 programs for better data.
